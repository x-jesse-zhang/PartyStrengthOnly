# Description

Garrisons in base Bannerlord does not do much besides drinking beer in their castle/towns. Village getting raided? More beer. Villagers or caravans under attack? We require more beer. Unless a town or castle is directly sieged by the enemy, a garrison contributes nothing to a Kingdom's strength. 

This mod removes the garrison strength from a kingdom's strength calculation - meaning the only indicator of kingdom strength are the sum of the various clans' war party strength. I believe this is a more accurate indication of how strong a kingdom is; if the in-game encyclopedia says Vlandia has 2000 strength and Garios decides to siege Sargot for the 50th time, then Vlandia can be expected to throw together army/armies of about 2000 strength. 

# \*\*\*\****Note***\*\*\*\*
I have not done extensive testing on the effects of this. Some gameplay side effects may include:
* Kingdoms are less likely to declare war due to less perceived strength
* Kingdoms with clans leaving will snowball faster towards their demise
	* For example, if Caladog only has 3 clans left but still hold 8 fiefs in Battania, previously the game will consider the 8 fief garrisons as part of Battanian strength so Battania will appear stronger than it actually is. With this mod, Battania will only have the strength of 3 clans' party strength, causing other kingdoms more likely to declare war on them. 

If this mod does break Bannerlord AI's "diplomacy" logic, consider either installing the excellent Diplomacy mod and/or I may consider adding back garrison strength but as a fraction of the total kingdom strength, i.e. garrisons are only worth 25% when it comes to calculating clan/kingdom strength. 

# Installation

Move the mod into your `/modules` folder or however you install other mods (via Vortex, etc.)

# Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with everything under the sun unless another mod directly modifies a clan or kingdom's strength calculation.
